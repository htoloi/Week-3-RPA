Introduction

IBM Robotic Process Automation with Automation Anywhere (RPA) is a new offering from IBM Digital Business Automation (DBA).
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) uses software robots (or bots) to automate activities that are performed by people, so that they can focus on higher value activities within your business. Typically, RPA is used to perform highly repetitive tasks that do not require any human judgment. RPA integrates with existing systems by using their Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and mimicking the keyboard and mouse actions of a human operator. This can radically improve time to value, reduce human error, increase throughput, and decrease development costs.
RPA is a digital process automation technology that complements the other offerings from IBM DBA including IBM Business Automation Workflow and IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM).
